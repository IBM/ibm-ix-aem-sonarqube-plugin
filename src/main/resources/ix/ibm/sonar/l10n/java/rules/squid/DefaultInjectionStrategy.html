<p>Argument defaultInjectionStrategy should be explicitly set in the Sling model annotation</p>

<p>There are use cases where you may need to get a Request object inside a Sling Model or you want to adapt your Sling Model using a SlingHttpServletRequest
    object. In both cases it is recommended to set optional injection strategy as default (DefaultInjectionStrategy.OPTIONAL), otherwise all the injected fields
    are assumed to be required by Sling.</p><h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
@Model(adaptables = SlingHttpServletRequest.class)
public class MyModel {}
</pre><h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
@Model(adaptables = SlingHttpServletRequest.class, defaultInjectionStrategy = DefaultInjectionStrategy.OPTIONAL)
public class MyModel {}
</pre>
